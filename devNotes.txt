-mno-cygwin 

Cygwin comes with the MingW libaries and headers and you can compile without linking to the cygwin1.dll by 
using -mno-cygwin flag with gcc. I greatly prefer this to using plain MingW and MSYS.
(  This does not work any more with cygwin 1.7.6. gcc: The -mno-cygwin flag has been removed; use a mingw-targeted cross-compiler. )
